In
cryptography,
a
substitution
cipher
is
a
method
of
encryption
by
which
units
of
plaintext
are
replaced
with
ciphertext
according
to
a
regular
system;
the
"units"
may
be
single
letters
(the
most
common),
pairs
of
letters,
triplets
of
letters,
mixtures
of
the
above,
and
so
forth.
The
receiver
deciphers
the
text
by
performing
an
inverse
substitution.
Substitution
ciphers
can
be
compared
with
transposition
ciphers.
In
a
transposition
cipher,
the
units
of
the
plaintext
are
rearranged
in
a
different
and
usually
quite
complex
order,
but
the
units
themselves
are
left
unchanged.
By
contrast,
in
a
substitution
cipher,
the
units
of
the
plaintext
are
retained
in
the
same
sequence
in
the
ciphertext,
but
the
units
themselves
are
altered.
There
are
a
number
of
different
types
of
substitution
cipher.
If
the
cipher
operates
on
single
letters,
it
is
termed
a
simple
substitution
cipher;
a
cipher
that
operates
on
larger
groups
of
letters
is
termed
polygraphic.
A
monoalphabetic
cipher
uses
fixed
substitution
over
the
entire
message,
whereas
a
polyalphabetic
cipher
uses
a
number
of
substitutions
at
different
times
in
the
message,
where
a
unit
from
the
plaintext
is
mapped
to
one
of
several
possibilities
in
the
ciphertext
and
vice-versa.

Substitution
over
a
single
letter—simple
substitution—can
be
demonstrated
by
writing
out
the
alphabet
in
some
order
to
represent
the
substitution.
This
is
termed
a
substitution
alphabet.
The
cipher
alphabet
may
be
shifted
or
reversed
(creating
the
Caesar
and
Atbash
ciphers,
respectively)
or
scrambled
in
a
more
complex
fashion,
in
which
case
it
is
called
a
mixed
alphabet
or
deranged
alphabet.
Traditionally,
mixed
alphabets
are
created
by
first
writing
out
a
keyword,
removing
repeated
letters
in
it,
then
writing
all
the
remaining
letters
in
the
alphabet.

A
disadvantage
of
this
method
of
derangement
is
that
the
last
letters
of
the
alphabet
(which
are
mostly
low
frequency)
tend
to
stay
at
the
end.
A
stronger
way
of
constructing
a
mixed
alphabet
is
to
perform
a
columnar
transposition
on
the
ordinary
alphabet
using
the
keyword,
but
this
is
not
often
done.
Although
the
number
of
possible
keys
is
very
large
(26!
≈
288.4,
or
about
88
bits),
this
cipher
is
not
very
strong,
being
easily
broken.
Provided
the
message
is
of
reasonable
length
(see
below),
the
cryptanalyst
can
deduce
the
probable
meaning
of
the
most
common
symbols
by
analyzing
the
frequency
distribution
of
the
ciphertext—frequency
analysis.
This
allows
formation
of
partial
words,
which
can
be
tentatively
filled
in,
progressively
expanding
the
(partial)
solution
(see
frequency
analysis
for
a
demonstration
of
this).
In
some
cases,
underlying
words
can
also
be
determined
from
the
pattern
of
their
letters;
for
example,
attract,
osseous,
and
words
with
those
two
as
the
root
are
the
only
common
English
words
with
the
pattern
ABBCADB.
Many
people
solve
such
ciphers
for
recreation,
as
with
cryptogram
puzzles
in
the
newspaper.
