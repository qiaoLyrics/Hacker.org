替换加密  非严格替换加密   有难度 
是做了“CipherQuest A Warmup”后来做这道题的，方法一模一样。
与“CipherQuest A Warmup”不同的是更乱，有更多不规则单词。
还有，多了‘A’元素。
其实做到下面结果我就不知道怎么猜解‘A’了（下面的译文用‘*’代替），然后grep了一下“isembo”，发现有“disembowel”
这个单词，抱着尝试一下的态度替换'*' -> 'd'。。。结果就对了。。

虽然还是替换加密，但解题时会遇到很多不规则非常见单词，甚至跟“CioherQuest A Warmup”一样有一对多、多对一的情况，
这就是考验人的地方吧。
